# Orbital Nexus - Project Context

## What is Orbital Nexus?

- Micro-SaaS platform for guided farming using multi-satellite data fusion
- Built for Hyperspace Innovation Hackathon 2026 (36-hour timeline, Feb 7-8)
- Addresses Indian agriculture supply-demand imbalances through AI-driven crop recommendations
- Fuses public satellite data (Sentinel, Landsat, ISRO) with soil, weather, and mandi price datasets
- Provides farmers with crop recommendations, price predictions, and sustainability guidance
- Demo-first mindset: Visual impact, stability, and judge comprehension prioritized over algorithmic depth
- Ethical focus: Public data only, guidance language (not predictions), sustainability-driven
- Target deployment: orbitalnexus.online (Hostinger)

## Hackathon Context

**Event**: Hyperspace Innovation Hackathon 2026 at IPEC, Ghaziabad, UP
**Problem Statement**: PS #4 - Multi-Satellite Data Fusion Dashboard
**Timeline**: 36 hours (3 PM Feb 7 to 1 PM Feb 8)
**Judging**: 10:30 AM - 1:00 PM Feb 8
**Mentor Rounds**: 4:00-5:30 PM (Day 1), 1:30-3:30 AM (Day 2)

## Timeline Pressure

- Working demo required by Mentor Round 2 (1:30 AM Feb 8)
- Visual impact critical for judging (maps, graphs, charts)
- Stability over complexity: Simple rule-based AI preferred over ML models
- Pre-computed results for default location (Greater Noida) for instant demo
- Offline-first: All data pre-loaded, no external API dependencies

## Demo-First Mindset

- Query → Response flow must work flawlessly
- Dashboard must render without errors
- Map must update smoothly
- Error handling must be graceful (no crashes during demo)
- Mobile responsive (judges may test on phones)
- Eco-friendly design (greens/blues) for visual appeal
