# Datasets — Orbital Nexus

## Strategy

All data is **offline** — no live API calls. We use publicly available satellite-derived datasets from Kaggle and open data portals.

## Dataset Sources

| Dataset       | Source                | Format | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Weather       | Kaggle / Open-Meteo   | CSV    | Temperature, rainfall, humidity |
| Soil Moisture | NASA SMAP (derived)   | CSV    | Soil water content              |
| NDVI          | MODIS/Sentinel-2      | CSV    | Vegetation health index         |
| Crop Patterns | India Crop Statistics | CSV    | Historical crop yield data      |
| Land Use      | ISRO Bhuvan (derived) | JSON   | Land classification             |

## Fusion Approach

1. **Spatial join**: All datasets aligned to lat/lon grid (0.1° resolution)
2. **Temporal alignment**: Monthly aggregation for consistency
3. **Cross-correlation**: Weather × Soil × NDVI → crop suitability score
4. **Output**: Single fused JSON per query region

## File Structure

```

## Notes

- Keep raw files under 50MB total for hackathon portability
- Processed files are generated by `scripts/preprocess_data.py` and `scripts/fuse_datasets.py`
